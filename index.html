          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Displayed above is an interactive scatter plot displaying the relationships between a variety of demographic variables. 
            By clicking on the axis titles, you can switch between the displays of each data category. 
          </p>

          <p>The dataset used to create this scatter plot consists of estimates from the 2014 US Census Bureau. Each bubble in the above plot 
            represents a US state and are labelled with the states' abbreviations. Although there were many more categories contained within the overall 
            dataset, this plot has been reduced to only compare age, poverty level, and median household income to the percentage of individuals in each state
            who are obese, smokers, or have healthcare. 
          </p>

          <p>Since this data set is quite old, it would be interesting if, in future projects, a comparison was made between this dataset and a more recent one. One 
            can expect quite a bit of change to have happened in the past seven year, so observing the directions of these trends could be insightful.
